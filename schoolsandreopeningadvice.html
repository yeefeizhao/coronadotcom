  			Schools and Reopening Advice
			</h1>
			<p>
				It’s blatantly obvious we’re not going back to the prototypical school environment that we all know and love. Here at (insert our brand name), we have a few thoughts on how to best increase productivity and success rate of our schools in the coming school year.

        The Problem: 
      </h2> 
			<p>
				First, let’s talk about the elephant in the room. Schools are high risk places. Young June Choe a paediatrician and epidemiologist stresses that children are crammed into poorly ventilated rooms for eight hours or more. “If schools are reopened in areas with high levels of community transmission, major outbreaks are inevitable and deaths will occur in the community as a result,” says Hyde. 
				<br>
				Studies in different countries have proven that schools can open safely when community transmission is low. The problem is, it isn’t. Most states that are reopening are arguably in a worse position than they already were, and if they aren’t, community transmission is still too high to safely open schools. 
				<br>
				An overnight camp in Georgia provided a glimpse into what schools could potentially look like. After one night of the camp, over 300 students tested positive for the virus.
